17th Aug. 2020, Vignesh Rajendran:

06th Okt. 2017, Monika Forstner
  - CommonAPI support 
  - Parallel Shutdown
      Clients will only be informed about next step once they answered to the last step they were informed about
      Overall timeouts for shutdown of parallel/serial clients (60:60 in normal and 2:3 in fast shutdown)
      Max Timeout for one client
  - Resume Node State (FullyOperational only once resume is finished)
  - Watchdog can actually supervise NSM instead of just a timer that triggeres systemd watchdog every x sec
  - setNodestate from external can be blocked
      will be blocked in case of Reset
      can be blocked in NSMC
  - NSM is no longer stopped when "shutdown" is reached but can live on and resume if necessary
  - Bootloader mode (argc and parameter in NSMA) 


16th Oct. 2013, Jean-Pierre Bogler:
  - Introduced parameters for restart reason and
    type in NSMC call.

19th Sep. 2013, Jean-Pierre Bogler:
  - Temporary fix to return the ApplicationMode
    in which we initially were in and not the
    ApplicationMode that recently was set.
  - Added dependency to pas-daemon.service to
    assert stable PCL handling.

09th Sep. 2013, Jean-Pierre Bogler:
  - Moved reading of "ApplicationMode" via PCL in
    the "Getter function", since we can't use PCL
    until the dbus interface is exported (because
    the PCL needs the dbus interface to register)

02nd Aug. 2013, Jean-Pierre Bogler:
  - Introduced PCL in NSM to store ApplicationMode
